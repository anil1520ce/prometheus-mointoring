### Features
- Prometheus offers the following key features:

* Multi-dimensional data model: Prometheus collects and stores time series data with flexible labels that allow slicing and filtering based on various dimensions.

* Powerful query language: PromQL enables you to perform ad-hoc queries, analyze data, and create custom dashboards.

* Alerting and notification: Prometheus allows you to set up alert rules based on metrics thresholds and send alerts via various channels like email, PagerDuty, Slack, etc.

* Scalable and reliable: Prometheus is built to handle large-scale deployments and supports horizontal scalability with a federated architecture.

* Data export and integrations: Prometheus supports exporting data to external storage systems and integrates with other monitoring tools like Grafana for visualization.


### Installation

- To install Prometheus, follow shell command given below .The file was in the master file .
~~~
sh install-prometheus.sh
~~~

### Configuration
- Prometheus's configuration is defined in a YAML file. The main configuration file is usually named prometheus.yml and contains information about the targets to scrape, alerting rules, storage options, and more.


### Usage
- Once Prometheus is installed and configured, you can start the Prometheus server and access the web interface. By default, the web interface runs on http://localhost:9090.

- Prometheus provides a powerful query language, PromQL, to explore and analyze your metrics. You can execute queries directly in the web interface or integrate them into your applications using the HTTP API.

### Alerting
- Prometheus allows you to set up alerting rules based on defined thresholds. Alerts can be configured to trigger based on metrics values, duration, and other conditions. When an alert fires, Prometheus sends notifications to various receivers, such as email, PagerDuty, or other third-party integrations. To configure alerting, refer to the alerting documentation and alertmanager documentation.

### Exporters
- Prometheus relies on exporters to collect metrics from different services. Exporters are small programs that expose metrics in a format that Prometheus can understand. Prometheus has an extensive list of official and community-supported exporters available for various applications, databases, and systems. Refer to the exporters documentation to find the right exporter for your use case.

### Grafana Integration
- Grafana is a popular open-source data visualization and dashboarding tool. By integrating Prometheus with Grafana, you can create beautiful and customizable dashboards to monitor your metrics effectively. Grafana provides rich visualization options, templating, and advanced querying capabilities.

~~~
sh install-grafana.sh
~~~

### Community and Support
- Prometheus has a vibrant community of users and contributors. If you need help or have questions, consider reaching out to the community through the following channels:
